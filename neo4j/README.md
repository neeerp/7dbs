# Neo4j
## Day 1

### Homework
#### Find
> 1. Browse through the Neo4j [docs](https://neo4j.com/docs) and read about
>    Cypher syntax. Find some Cypher features mentioned there that we didn't
>    cover today, and pick your favourite.

One obvious one that I kind of figured on my own: `RETURN DISTINCT` to filter
duplicate results. Some other cool ones include aggregating functions like
`count(*)`, being able to `SKIP` the first n rows of a result set, assigning
entires paths to variable with `p=(n)-[r]->(m)`.

> 2. Experiment with an example graph consisting of movie-related data by going
>    back to the browser console and typing `:play movie-graph`, following the
>    instructions to come.

Done that. Would call this more of a 'Do' than a 'Find'.

#### Do
> 1. Create a simple graph describing some of your closest friends, your
>    relationships with them, and even some relationships between your friends.
>    Start with three nodes, including one for yourself. Create five
>    relationships.

Done, though I'm not going to copy my console commands here.
